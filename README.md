Project "Odin Recipes" consists in structuring a main index page with 3 recipe pages while practicing html elements such as headings, paragraphs, images and lists(ordered and unordered).

Each page is structured in the same manner with the title being used as an h1 element, a description for each recipe as a p element. Ingredients and steps we're added as ul and ol elements respectively containing their corresponding number of li elements.
