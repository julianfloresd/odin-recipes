Project "Odin Recipes" consists in structuring a main index page with 3 recipe pages while practicing html elements such as headings, paragraphs, images and lists(ordered and unordered).

Each page is structured in the same manner with the title being used as an h1 element, a description for each recipe as a paragraph element. Ingredients and steps we're added as unordered list and ordered list elements respectively containing their corresponding number of list elements.
